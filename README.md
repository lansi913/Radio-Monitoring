# ➡️ Folder Structure Overview

The folder consists of three parts:

## 📊 data

* The radio displacement samples from two hospital cohorts of patients with cardiac abnormalities comprise 172 patients in the Ruijin folder and 259 patients in the Xinhua folder.
* Each CSV file containing radio displacement samples includes 30-second sample segments at a sampling rate of 50Hz.
* A file named 'disp_mask.ipynb' demonstrates the process of masking displacement waveforms.

## 🧱 Pre-traing

* Module

## 🕹️Fine-tuning
* Lora

# 🔧 Installation

Install Python 3.9 and necessary dependencies.

### Python
pip install -r requirements.txt 
###

# 🔥 Pre-traing and Fine-tunning neraul network

## 1️⃣ Wash the unlabelled data as the pre-traing dataset. 

## 2️⃣ Train the pre-traing model.

## 3️⃣ Fine-tune the base model to downstream tasks.
